ANA: Asset Analysis
===================

In this panel the user can select the applications that will be used to analyze each asset class. The user can select the type of asset from the ``Asset Selection Ribbon``, e.g., Buildings and Gas Network, as shown on the left-hand side of :numref:`fig-buildingAnalysisPanel`. The ``Asset Selection Ribbon`` appears when more than one type of asset is selected in the **GI: General Information** panel. Moreover, only the assets that are checked in the **GI: General Information** panel will appear in the ``Asset Selection Ribbon``. As the user switches between assets, the ``Input Panel changes`` to reflect the applications available for the analysis of each type of asset.
