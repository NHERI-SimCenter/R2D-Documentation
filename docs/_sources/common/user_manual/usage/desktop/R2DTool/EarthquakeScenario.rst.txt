Earthquake Scenario Simulation
------------------------------

This tool dialog is where user can enter data on an earthquake scenario and the tool will generate a series of ground motions for a series of points in the area. The application employs OpenSHA, determining which records to select from a ground motion database. The **Earthquake Scenario Simulation** input panel is given in :numref:`fig-EQSSPanel` and the individual input panes are discussed below.

**Site Definition Parameters**

This is where a user defines the geographical locations where ground motion selection will occur. A user can select to input a single location, multiple locations on a grid, or a collection of scattered sites as seen in the **Grid Type Selection** box in the top-left corner of :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSSiteSinglePane`.
    
    #. **Single Location**

	In the **Single Location** pane, shown in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSSiteSinglePane`, the user needs to provide the following inputs:

		- **Location:** The latitude and longitude of the site.
		- **Number of Ground Motions per Site:** The number of ground motions that will be selected at the site.

    #. **Grid of Locations**

	In the **Grid of Locations** input pane, given in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSSiteGridPane`, the user can either manually define a grid, or select a grid on a map. To manually define a grid, the user needs to provide the following input parameters:

		- **Latitude Extents:**  The minimum and maximum latitude values that the grid will span.
   		- **Longitude Extents:** The minimum and maximum longitude values that the grid will span.

	In addition to defining the geographical extents of the grid, the user must also provide the following inputs:

   		- **Number of Ground Motions per Site:** The number of ground motions that will be selected at each grid point.
   		- **Latitude Discretization:** The number of divisions along the latitude direction.
   		- **Longitude Discretization:** The number of divisions along the longitude direction.

	  Grid of locations site definition pane.

	To select a grid on a map, the user needs to click on the **Define Grid on Map** button and a new **Grid Selection Window** will appear with the grid, as seen in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSGridSelection`. A user can click and drag the **Resize** and **Move** handles, shown in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSGridSelection` as blue circles, to resize the grid extents and to move the grid. Changing the grid discretization along the latitude and longitude directions will change the number of grid divisions on the map. Once a grid is defined on the map, the window can be closed and the grid information will be updated in the input pane. To view or modify the grid again, press the **Define Grid on Map** button and the **Grid Selection Window** displaying the grid will reappear.

    #. **Scattered Locations**

  	In the **Scattered Locations** input pane, given in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSSiteScatterPane`, the user provides a custom list of sites. The following inputs are required:

		- **Site File:** The user provided file, in ``.csv`` format, containing the list of sites and corresponding site data. At a minimum the site file must contain the station number, latitude, and longitude of each site, as seen in the **Site Preview Table** in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSSiteScatterPane`.
		- **Site Preview Table:** Table providing the information at each site. Apart from the station number, latitude, and longitude at each site, the site file can include other information such as the Vs30 at the site. 
		- **Minimum and Maximum Site ID:** The minimum and maximum site IDs considered.
		- **Number of Ground Motions per Site:** The number of ground motions that will be selected at each site.

**Spatial Correlation and Ground Motion Scaling Factors**

This is where the user selects the spatial correlation models, and where the user defines the minimum and maximum scaling factors that are used in ground motion selection. Shown at the top of :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSCorrScalePane`, the user has the option to select the Intra- and Inter-event Spatial Correlation Models. Spatial correlation ensures that ground motions at different locations will share similar characteristics. The following Inter-event Spatial Correlation Models are available:

	- Baker & Jayaram (2008)

and the following Intra-event Spatial Correlation Models are available:

	- Markhvida et al. (2017)
	- Jayaram & Baker (2009)
	- Loth & Baker (2013)

Special thanks to Dr. Anne Husley for sharing the python package `seaturtles <https://github.com/annehulsey/seaturtles>`_, especially for the method of computing the regional ground motion intensity using the Markhvida et al. (2017) and Baker & Jayaram (2008) correlation models. 

The **Ground Motion Record Scaling Bounds**, shown at the bottom of :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSCorrScalePane`, are the minimum and maximum scaling factors that intensity measures can be scaled by during the ground motion selection process.

**Ground Motion Record Database**

Ground motion records are selected from a ground motion database. Currently, only the *PEER NGA-West2* database is available, shown in the **Ground Motion Record Database** combo box in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSGMDBPane`. Alternatively, a user can select *None* to skip ground motion selection altogether. In that case, only the intensity measures will be saved at each location.

**Ground Motion Prediction Equations**

Ground motion prediction equations estimate the intensity of ground shaking that may occur at a site. The **Ground Motion Prediction Equation** combo box, shown in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSGMPEPane`, contains the following ground motion prediction equations:

**Output Directory and Run Button**

Shown at the bottom of :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSOutputDirPane`, the **Run Hazard Simulation** button starts the ground motion selection application. The **Output Directory** box, provided in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSOutputDirPane`, allows the user to select a directory that will contain the input and output files of the earthquake scenario simulation.

.. _fig-R2DEQSSOutputDirPane:

.. figure:: figures/R2DEQSSOutputDirPane.png
  :align: center
  :figclass: align-center

  Earthquake Scenario Simulation Output Directory.

The earthquake scenario simulation is run via a Python script. When the **Run Hazard Simulation** button is pressed, text output from the script will appear in the **Program Output** console at the bottom of the application.
	Upon successful completion of the earthquake scenario simulation, results from the simulation are in the **Output Directory** folder that is specified above, as shown in :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSOutputDirPane`. The final output is a ``.csv`` file called ``EventGrid.csv``. The ``EventGrid.csv`` file contains the grid points and their locations and file names. Each grid point is assigned a ``.csv`` file containing a list of the ground motions at the grid point and their scaling factors. If applicable, the corresponding ground motion records, in ``JSON`` format, are also in the **Output Directory** directoy. Next, the ``EventGrid.csv`` is post-processed, and a new layer containing the ground motions is added to the GIS widget. Shown on the right-hand side of :numref:`fig-R2DEQSSOutput`, the grid points are represented with a cross symbol. Clicking on a grid point will produce a popup with information about the ground motions at that point.
