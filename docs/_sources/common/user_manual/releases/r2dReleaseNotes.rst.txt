Release Notes
***************************

Version 4.1.0 (Current)
-----------------------

**Release date:** March 2024

**Highlights**

#. Upgrade the earthquake event generation toolbox to support simulation of Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) and liquefaction induced Permanent Ground Deformation (PGD).
#. Enhancements to the BRAILS-Buildings widget, providing detailed user interaction with the existing BRAILS building inventory generation capabilities. In brief, these enhancements enable:
   
   #. Importing footprint and building data from i) OpenStreetMaps, ii) Microsoft Global Building Footprints dataset, iii) FEMA USA Structures, and iv) user-specified data sources.
   #. Using National Structures Inventory data or other user-specified data to create a baseline building inventory.
   #. Requesting a subset of BRAILS attributes for inventory generation.

#. Update the damage and loss engine Pelicun to v3.3. 

Version 4.0.1
-----------------------

**Release date:** Jan. 2024

**Highlights**

#. Support the assessment of transportation infrastructure.
#. Revised interface for earthquake scenario simulation tool.

Version 2.0.0
-------------
**Release date:** Dec. 2021

#. QGIS integrated into R2D with the ability to:

   #. load several types of GIS files into R2D to visualize and extract information post-process results based on advanced queries and expression filters join external databases to GIS features to add additional information for pre- and post-processing export GIS layers into many supported formats for viewing in other GIS applications

#. Filtering of assets to include in an analysis based on advanced queries and expressions

#. OpenQuake source selection tool

   #. OpenQuake Scenario-Based Seismic Hazard Analysis to calculate intensity measure from OpenQuake rupture sources
   #. OpenQuake Classical Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis to calculate intensity measures from OpenQuake seismic source and ground motion logic trees

#. Widget to import building inventory in ShapeFile format

version updates to 2.0.0 as older versions run at design-safe will not load due to changes in backend.
